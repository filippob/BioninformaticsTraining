Bioninformatics & Biostatistics Training
=======================

Material from courses, training and research activities.
- notes
- theoretical insights
- worked out notebooks with exercises (R, Python)

### First project

1. super-quick recap of linear mixed models
2. application to genetics and breeding: from BLUP to GBLUP
3. an alternative parameterization: the SNP-BLUP
4. how to do cross-validation with SNP-BLUP
5. how to do cross-validation with GBLUP
